# Web_Scraping_Project

The goal of this project is to web scrape price data from an article on Amazon.<br>
The user is reciving an email if the price drops under a certain price condition.<br>
For demonstrating purposes the time variable is set to a short time frame. It can be changed to 86400 to check the price on a daily base.
